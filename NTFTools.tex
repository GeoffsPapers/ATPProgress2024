\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

The TPTP World \cite{Sut17} is a well established infrastructure that supports research, 
development, and deployment of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems.
The TPTP World includes the TPTP problem library,
% \cite{Sut09}, 
the TSTP solution library,
% \cite{Sut10}, 
standards for writing ATP problems and reporting ATP solutions,
% \cite{SS+06,Sut08-KEAPPA}, 
tools and services for processing ATP problems and solutions,
% \cite{Sut10}, 
and it supports the CADE ATP System Competition (CASC).
% \cite{Sut16}.
Various parts of the TPTP World have been deployed in a range of applications,
in both academia and industry.
The web page \href{https://www.tptp.org}{\tt www.tptp.org} provides access to all 
components.

The development of the TPTP World has until now focused mostly on classical logic, while many 
real-world applications of ATP often also require non-classical reasoning. 
These applications include artificial intelligence (e.g., knowledge representation, planning, 
multi-agent systems), philosophy (e.g., formal ethics, metaphysics), natural language semantics 
(e.g., generalized quantifiers, modalities), and computer science (e.g., software and hardware 
verification).
This paper describes the latest extension of the TPTP World, providing languages and
infrastructure for reasoning in non-classical logics \cite{Pri08,Gob01}.
In this paper the languages and infrastructure are exemplified using modal logics \cite{BBW06}.

Section~\ref{TPTPLanguages} reviews the general structure of the TPTP languages and

\section{The Non-classical TPTP Languages}
\label{TPTPLanguages}

The TPTP languages for first-order clause normal form (CNF) \cite{SS98-JAR}, full first-order 
form (FOF) \cite{Sut09}, typed-first order form (TFF) \cite{SS+12,BP13-TFF1}, and typed 
higher-order form (THF) \cite{SB10,KSR16} are by now well known and regularly documented.
An overview that is relevant to this paper is provided in \cite{SF+22}, and the detailed
syntax of the languages is given in an extended BNF\footnote{%
\href{https://www.tptp.org/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html}{\tt www.tptp.org/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html}
\label{BNF}} \cite{VS06}.
As a simple reminder, here is an example monomorphic typed extended first-order (TX0) annotated 
formula~\ldots
\[
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
    tff(leaf_knaves_lie,axiom,
        ! [I: inhabitant,S: $o] : 
          ( ( is_knave(I) & says(I,S) ) => ~ S ),
        file('PUZ081_8.p',knaves_lie),
        [description('Knaves always lie'), relevance(0.9)]).
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\]
TXF (which breaks down into the monomorphic TX0 and polymorphic TX1) provides the basis for the 
non-classical typed extended first-order form (NXF).

The non-classical typed extended first-order form (NXF) and non-classical typed higher-order 
form (NHF) languages are the TPTP languages for non-classical logics.
NXF and NHF add an interpreted connective form
{\tt \verb|{|\$}{\em name}{\tt \verb|}|}.
Example {\em name}s are {\tt box}, {\tt dia}, {\tt possible}, {\tt necessary},
{\tt obligatory}, {\tt permissible}, {\tt knows}, {\tt believes}, etc.
In NXF the non-classical connectives are applied in a mixed applied/functional style, with the 
connectives applied to a {\tt ()}ed list of arguments.
In NHF the non-classical connectives are applied in higher-order style.
Figure~\ref{NX0Example} shows example types and alethic modal logic formulae in NX0.
A {\em name} may optionally be parameterized to reflect more complex non-classical connectives, 
e.g., in epistemic logic where the agent of knowledge is an index,
{\tt \verb|{|\$knows(\#manuel)\verb|}| @ (nothing)}\footnote{%
As in 
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISD86-oM4Ow}{\tt www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISD86-oM4Ow}}.
There are also {\em short form} unary connectives for (unparameterised) {\tt \$box} and 
{\tt \$dia}: {\tt [.]} and {\tt <.>}, e.g., {\tt \verb|{|\$box\verb|}| @ p} can be written 
{\tt [.] p}.
The syntax for formulae in non-classical logics is captured in the extended BNF with
{\tt <nhf\_long\_conn\-ective>}, {\tt <nxf\_atom>}, {\tt <nxf\_long\_conn\-ective>},
{\tt <ntf\_short\_conn\-ective>}, and {\tt <tff\_logic\_defn>},
The NXF and NHF languages can be used to write problems that are not naturally expressed in
classical logics.
Figure~\ref{NX0Example} shows a NX0 example problem.

In non-classical logics the same language can be used for formulae while different logics are 
used for reasoning.
It is therefore necessary to provide \mbox{(meta-)} information that specifies the
logic to be used.
A new kind of TPTP annotated formula has been introduced for this, with the role \texttt{logic},
and a ``logic specification'' as the formula.
A logic specification consists of a defined logic (family) name identified with a list of 
properties.
Figure~\ref{NX0Example} includes a logic specification in NX0 (note, the property names have
been improved since their presentation in \cite{SF+22}).

\section{Non-classical Proof and Models}
\label{ProofsModels}

The TPTP format for derivations \cite{SS+06} can immediately be used for writing derivations in
non-classical logic.

The new TPTP format for interpretations \cite{SS+23-LPAR} can be used to write Kripke models.
The worlds of a Kripke interpretation have the defined type {\tt \$ki\_world}, and are known to 
be distinct.
The defined predicate {\tt \$ki\_world\_is} of type {\tt \$ki\_world~>~\$o} is used to recognize 
worlds.
The defined predicate {\tt \$ki\_access\-ible} of type {\tt (\$ki\_world~*~\$ki\_world)~>~\$o} is
used to specify the accessibility between worlds.
Finally, the defined constant {\tt \$ki\_local\_world} of type {\tt \$ki\_world} is the world in
which a problem's conjecture must be proved. 
The Tarskian interpretations within worlds also use the new TPTP format for interpretations,
with guards used to specify the worlds in which the Tarskian interpretation is used.
Figure~\ref{NX0Kripke} shows the worlds and the first world's interpretation for a Kripke
model in NX0, for the problem in Figure~\ref{NX0Example}.

At the time of writing there are no ATP systems that can output proofs or Kripke models
in TPTP format for non-classical logic problems (hopefully given in TPTP format).
See Section~\ref{ATPSystems} for more information about non-classical logic ATP systems' 
capabilities.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Inside the TPTP}
\label{InsideTPTP}

A core piece of TPTP infrastructure is the TPTP problem library of test problems for
ATP systems.
To start with, problems in monomodal normal modal logic are being collected, including problems 
from (the citations are just some examples)
books \cite{For94,FM98,Gir00,Sid10}, 
conference and journal papers \cite{Rei92,FH+98,Sto00,PN+21}, 
and 
use cases \cite{BW14-ECAI,MR22}.

The headers of non-classical logic problems have been updated to include relevant information.
The {\tt Syntax} field includes the number of classical connectives in the long form, the 
number that are indexed, and the number of connectives in the short-form, e.g,
the {\tt Number of connectives} data for the problem in Figure~\ref{NX0Example} is\ldots
\begin{verbatim}
    8 (   2   ~;   0   |;   1   &)
      (   0 <=>;   1  =>;   0  <=;   0 <~>)
      (   4 {}@;   0 {#};   0 {.})
\end{verbatim}
CHECK THIS GEOFF
\ldots~, i.e., four non-classical connectives, none are indexed, and none are in short form.
The {\tt SPC} field has values for non-classical logic problems, e.g., the SPC for the problem 
in Figure~\ref{NX0Example} is {\tt NX0\_THM\_NEQ\_NAR}.
The syntax and SPC information is part of the {\tt ProblemAndSolutionStatistics} file in the 
{\tt Documents} directory of the TPTP distribution.

The TPTP World utilities TPTP4X and TPTP2T \cite{Sut07-CSR,Sut10}, and the BNF-based suite
of parsers \cite{VS06}, can work with non-classical problems and problem data.
TPTP4X parses problems, can apply various transformations, and pretty-prints the formulae.
TPTP2T selects problems and solutions with specified syntactic and sematic characteristics,
e.g., it could be used to list non-classical problems in NXF that are theorems, contain equality,
and are easy to prove.
The BNF-based parsers offer stricter parsing the TPTP4X, and can present the parse trees in
various forms.
All these tools are freely available from GitHub\footnote{%
\href{https://github.com/TPTPWorld}{\tt github.com/TPTPWorld}}, and online in 
SystemOnTPTP\footnote{%
\href{https://www.tptp.org/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTP}{\tt www.tptp.org/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTP}}.

In addition to the TPTP World's own tools, a suite of tools that can read and manipulate 
problems written in the NXF and NHF languages is available in the Leo-III framework \cite{SB21},
and are also available in SystemonTPTP.
At the front end, the {\tt tptp-utils} tool \cite{Ste22-TU} for pre- and post-processing TPTP 
problems (in all the TPTP languages) can be used on NXF and NHF problems.
It does syntax checking, reparsing, translations, and linting.
For NXF and NHF in particular, it can sanity check logic specifications for modal logics.
Leo-III's parser is available as a stand-alone parsing library \cite{Ste21}.
IS THIS THE SAME AS IN tptp-utils? SAY WHAT IT OFFERS TO OTHERS.
As a stepping stone into ATP for NXF and NHF problems, the NTF Logic Embedding Tool {\tt NTFLET} 
\cite{Ste22-LE} does a shallow embedding of NXF and NHF problems in classical logic 
\cite{BP13,BR13,GSB17,GS18}.
NXF problems that do not quantify over booleans can be embedded in TXF, or to THF.
IS THAT NX0 to TX0 and NX1 to TX1? CHECK DETAILS.
NHF problems are embedded in THF. SAME QUESTION.
This allows any TPTP-compliant TXF/THF ATP system to be added as a backend to form an 
ATP system for NXF/NHF.
This capability is built into Leo-III \cite{WHAT}.
Currently NTFLET supports the range of modal logics presented above, a range of first-order
quantified hybrid logics, public announcement logic, and two different dyadic deontic logics.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{ATP Systems and Proofs}
\label{ATPSystems}

ATP for non-classical logic is a well established, and successful at least at the propositional
level, endeavour.
The systems that we know about are
K\raisebox{-3pt}{S}P \cite{NHD20,PN+21}, nanoCoP-M \cite{Ott21}, MleanCoP \cite{Ott14}, 
MetTeL2 \cite{TSK12}, Leo-III \cite{SB21}, LoTREC \cite{FF+01}, and MSPASS \cite{HS00-TABLEAUX}.
Front-end have been added to K\raisebox{-3pt}{S}P, nanoCoP-M, and MleanCoP to translate NXF
and NHF problems to the systems' syntax, and can thus be used on the problems.
Leo-III can used on NXF and NHF problems natively, via the embedding approach described in 
Section~\ref{InsideTPTP}.
These four systems are available in SystemOnTPTP.
As noted there, any TPTP-compliant TXF/THF ATP system can replace Leo-III as the backend after
the embedding, thus offering a suite of system variants.

The TPTP World has several tools for processing proofs and models in non-classical logic.
Although are no ATP systems that output TPTP format proofs for non-classical problems, the
GDV derivation verifier \cite{Sut06} will be able verify such proofs.
Similarly, the IDV Interactive Derivation Viewer \cite{TPS07} will be able to display such proofs.
The AGMMV model verifier for Kripke models can verify WHAT - NXF models?
The IIV Interactive Interpretation Viewer \cite{MS23-Poster} can be used to interact with the
Tarskian interpretations within the worlds of a Kripke model. 
A wrapper to view the worlds and accessibility relationship of a Kripke model is being developed,
which will be linked to the existing IIV to view a chosen world's Tarskian interpretation.
GDV, IDV, AGMMV, and IIV are all available in SystemOnTPTP.
